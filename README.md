# Non-Unique

Algorithm:
  This program is suppose to take out any value that is unique by:
    1. Checking the array for duplicate values
    2. Checking for values that are unique
  Then the program will filter out this unique value by:
    1. Checking a variable to see if the statment is true by checking the variable to be bigger than one
      1. if this statment is false then it would remove this number from the array
